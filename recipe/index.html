			<h2>HOW TO MAKE THIS</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Pull up a piece of entertainment because you might be here a while.</li>

				<li>Toss a few pinches of salt into a small bowl of water (e.g. WashU honeydew containers).</li>

				<li>Wet hands with <span class="highlight">saltwater</span> and grab a handful of <span class="highlight">rice</span>.</li>
				
				<li>Mold rice into <span class="highlight">triangles </span>(illustrations below: 1). You can use a spoon or similar flat edge, though wet hands work perfectly well and mean one less utensil to rinse.</li>

				<li>Make a small <span class="highlight">indentation</span> in the rice with your finger (don't stab through completely, though), and pat in your filling (illustrations below: 2-4).</li>

				<li>Slap triangles of rice onto a sheet of <span class="highlight">nori seaweed</span>.</li> 

				<li>Fold and wrap the nori seaweed over the rice ball to <span class="highlight">enclose</span> it.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>â€” <span class="highlight">RINSE-REPEAT</span>: MAKE AS MANY AS YOU NEED!</p>

			<p>THEN, enjoy immediately, or if you're a sinner like me, wrap them in <span class="highlight">cling wrap</span> and toss them in the fridge for consumption one to three days later, because hardened rice and softened seaweed is really not much of a problem! Everyone else is just foolishly picky!</p>

		<h2>TIPS + ALTERNATIVES</h2>
			<div class="center_column">
				<ul>
					<li>My mom molds the rice with cling wrap instead of her hands, and photos suggest that works perfectly well.</li>

					<li>You can also forgo the the nori seaweed: the rice ball will still stay packed together unless you're using say, jasmine rice, which is too hard and dry to stick together long, and also hardens into gravel after a night of refrigeration (I speak from ill-considered experience).</li>

					<li>If the rice is sticking too much to your hands and making it difficult to mold, just soak your hands in more water. Water solves many problems, from survival to adhesion.</li>

					<li>There are onigiri rice molds sold, but it's quite a lot of trouble to get the necessarily sticky rice out of the molds once it's been packed in, which somewhat defeats the purpose.</li>
