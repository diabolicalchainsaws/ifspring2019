	<h2>Feedback for Selina Wu — Claire H.</h2>

	<p>Text is always legible.</p>

	<p>Might feel more like a set if the first image's font were the same as the other two, and the line height (between both individual lines in the quotes and between the quotes and their respective attributions) were consistent.</p>

	<p>The attributions could also be bigger on the "mobile" versions — I don't think it'd hurt if the quote and attribution font size were closer there.</p>

	<p>On the "desktop" version of Ross Geller's, maybe move the attribution closer to the center, under the quote? It takes a little moment to find.</p>

	<p>Kiki image might need some sharpening.</p>

	<p>Otherwise, though, I think they work well!</p>
