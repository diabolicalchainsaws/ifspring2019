	<h1>Greetings!</h1>

	<ol>
		<li id="1">I'm Claire Huang, a sophomore going for the BA in Design with a second major in History.
		</li>
		
		<li id="two">Background, my father is an electronics aficionado, which makes me especially self-conscious of my ignorance. 
			<p>Reasons, several!
			<ul>
				<li>I'd quite like to have at least a little agency in the design of my eventual portfolio site.</li>
				<li>At this point, I get the sense that some understanding of coding is a basic life skill.</li>
				<li>I need a 300-level studio.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li id="3">Nope.
		</li>
		
		<li id="4">Enough of the fundamentals of HTML/CSS to allow me to identify what I ought to hope to learn in order to build a website.
		</li>
		
		<li id="5">Getting a composition won't be as simple as drawing it.	
		</li>
		
		<li id="6">(Perhaps because of a contrast with its hideous precursor Deviantart), I think <a href="https://www.artstation.com/">Artstation</a> has a very sleek design. It's meant to be swamped with images, and the square thumbnails handle that well in both profiles and its homepage. Its homepage also deals out a lot of information without becoming too overwhelming in itself.
		</li>
		
		<li id="7">I think <a href="https://www.vandalhigh.com/">Peter Mohrbacher</a> has an effectively straightforward portfolio site ("MTG," "Concept Art," "Angelarium," "Mentorships," pretty much whatever we might want him for is right there), particularly since it also has to handle viewers unfamiliar with his big Angelarium project. He also includes titles under his pieces, which is helpful.
		</li>
		
		<li id="8">I actually think <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive">Google Drive</a> is pretty intuitive, e.g. I once absently tried clicking and dragging a file and the "My Drive" folders on the left, surprisingly, complied. 
			
		</li>
